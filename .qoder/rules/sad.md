No errors allowed: Always generate syntactically correct code without missing imports, brackets, or typos.

Type safety first: Prefer strongly typed code (use TypeScript if possible).

Follow best practices: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Consistent style: Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes).

Comment critical logic: Add short, clear comments to explain non-obvious parts.

Error handling: Always handle possible errors (try/catch, validations, fallback values).

Avoid hardcoding: Use constants, environment variables, or configs instead of magic numbers/strings.

Reusable code: Extract repeated logic into functions/components.

Performance awareness: Write efficient code; avoid unnecessary loops, queries, or re-renders.

Security first: Sanitize inputs, avoid exposing sensitive data, and follow secure coding practices.
