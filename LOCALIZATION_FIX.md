# Localization Fix

## Issue
The app was encountering a runtime error: "Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing('RNLocalize') could not be found." This error occurred because the `react-native-localize` package was not properly linked or configured in the Expo project.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:

1. **Installing the required packages**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-localization
   npx expo install react-native-localize
   ```

2. **Updating the LocalizationContext**:
   - Kept both `expo-localization` and `react-native-localize` imports
   - Used the correct API methods from `react-native-localize`:
     - `RNLocalize.getLocales()` to get device locales
     - `RNLocalize.getCountry()` to get device region
   - Maintained the same language detection logic but with proper API usage

## Key Changes in LocalizationContext.tsx

### Before (causing error):
```typescript
// Incorrect API usage
const deviceLanguage = Localization.locale.split('-')[0];
const region = Localization.region;
```

### After (fixed):
```typescript
// Correct API usage
const deviceLocales = RNLocalize.getLocales();
const deviceLanguage = deviceLocales[0]?.languageCode;
const region = RNLocalize.getCountry();
```

## Why This Fixed the Issue

1. **Proper Package Installation**: Using `npx expo install` ensures that packages are installed with the correct versions compatible with the Expo SDK version.

2. **Correct API Usage**: The `react-native-localize` package has specific methods for getting device information that must be used instead of trying to access properties directly.

3. **Expo Compatibility**: Expo has specific ways of handling native modules, and using `npx expo install` ensures proper configuration.

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Starting the app successfully without the runtime error
2. Confirming that language detection still works correctly
3. Verifying that manual language selection still functions properly

## Future Considerations
- Keep dependencies up to date with compatible versions
- Use `npx expo install` for Expo-specific packages to ensure proper configuration
- Test on both iOS and Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility
