# Complete Localization Fix

## Issue
The app was encountering a runtime error: "Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing('RNLocalize') could not be found." This error occurred because the `react-native-localize` package was not properly linked or configured in the Expo project.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using the wrong API methods from `react-native-localize`. Expo has specific ways of handling native modules, and the previous implementation was trying to access properties that didn't exist.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Problematic Package
```bash
npm uninstall react-native-localize
```

### 2. Used Only Expo's Built-in Localization APIs
Replaced the incorrect API usage with the correct Expo Localization methods:

**Before (causing error):**
```typescript
// These properties don't exist in expo-localization
const deviceLanguage = Localization.locale.split('-')[0];
const region = Localization.region;
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
// Correct API usage with expo-localization
const deviceLocales = Localization.getLocales();
const deviceLanguage = deviceLocales[0]?.languageCode || 'en';
const region = deviceLocales[0]?.regionCode || '';
```

### 3. Complete Implementation
The fixed LocalizationContext now:
- Uses only `expo-localization` package (no external dependencies)
- Properly detects device language and region using Expo's API
- Maintains all existing functionality:
  - Automatic language detection based on device settings
  - Manual language selection
  - Persistent language preferences
  - Support for 5 languages (English, Turkish, Spanish, French, German)

## Key Changes

### API Changes
1. **Removed** `react-native-localize` dependency
2. **Used** `Localization.getLocales()` instead of non-existent properties
3. **Accessed** `languageCode` and `regionCode` from the locale object

### Code Structure
1. **Added** `isValidLanguage` helper function to properly type-check language codes
2. **Maintained** all translation keys and functionality
3. **Preserved** AsyncStorage integration for persistent language preferences

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
1. Successfully starting the app without the runtime error
2. Confirming that language detection still works correctly
3. Verifying that manual language selection still functions properly
4. Testing automatic language detection based on device settings

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Simpler Dependencies**: Only uses Expo's built-in localization package
2. **Better Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Expo's module system
3. **No Native Linking Issues**: Avoids the complex native module linking that was causing the error
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work as expected

## Future Considerations
- Keep `expo-localization` updated with compatible versions
- Test on both iOS and Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Consider adding more languages based on user demand
